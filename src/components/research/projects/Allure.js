Enabled via an XAI chatbot and AI-driven solutions, we've developed a user interface that breaks down problem solving techniques for the Rubikâ€™s cube to be comprehensive at any skill level. This is an ongoing project with applications in pedagogical strategies, metacognition, explainable AI, and HCI. Our future research will continue to investigate improved user experiences and Human-AI interactions through usability studies and inductive qualitative analysis.  "
